# Task Management App

## Overview
The **Task Management App** is a simple application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** to manage tasks efficiently. This application supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with an intuitive interface powered by **EJS** templates. Users can create tasks, view all tasks, edit task details, mark tasks as done, and delete tasks.

- **Mark as Done**: Mark tasks as completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid routes and operations gracefully with error messages.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
- **Utilities**: `ejs-mate` for layout templates, `method-override` for HTTP verbs, `Joi` for validation
